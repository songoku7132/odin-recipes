        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A quick bath in boiling water gives you the perfect jammy eggs—and while 
            your eggs cool off in the ice bath, you can make the sauce, which is loaded 
            with the same ingredients you'll find in a classic seafood boil recipe.</p>
        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 5 mins</p>    
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 15 mins</p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 20 mins</p>
        <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 4</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced white onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning(such as Old Bay)</li>
            <li>½ cup low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth, or water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a small pot filled halfway with water over high heat and bring to a boil. 
                Once boiling, carefully add eggs and let boil for 6 minutes. Remove from heat and 
                let sit for 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small skillet set over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook 
                until fragrant and softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until fragrant and golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in hot sauce, Old Bay seasoning, and chicken 
                broth and cook 4 minutes, until slightly reduced. Remove skillet from the heat and stir in lemon 
                juice and parsley.</li>
            <li>Peel the eggs and place in a serving bowl. Pour sauce over the eggs and garnish with remaining parsley.</li>    
        </ol>
